  This is the main application stylesheet. It should include or import
  all stylesheets used throughout the application as this is the only
  stylesheet in the Grunt configuration that is automatically processed.

  This will bring in all of foundation's components. If you don't need
  all of them go into ./vendor/foundation/scss/_foundation.scss and
  comment out the ones you don't need. This will make the css file smaller
  and load faster.
